## Slide 2
Evolution of Web applications
- Plain HTML -> Form example with back-end validation
  None of the problems but really lame
- HTML + js file -> Form example
  Breaks immediately when not maintained properly (give example)
- Server rendered HTML + embedded js -> Hand made or Lift form example
  Solves one part of maintenance problem, but js is kept embedded within host language, which has it's own problems
- Other??
- API backend + Typescript Frontend
- Integrated Scala backend + ScalaJS frontend

the problem:
how do we know we have a problem?
- Data structures have to be declared and maintained bothways
- We can see similar code back and Front
- things break silently(js) when we loose sync
